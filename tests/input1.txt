Software based on so-called genetic algorithms is "showing up
in every way".
Genetic algorithms are widely used for different applications.
Sheer hardware power ought to tell---some day. Way back in
1982, the legendary programmer Kenneth Thompson stages a
landmark experiment that determined exactly how much better
a chess program would play if given the opportunity to look
further ahead. (Thompson, a researcher at Bell Laboratories
in Murray Hill, N.J., was a designer of Unix.) Thompson pitted
his then-top chess machine, Belle, against itself in hundreds
of games, calculating its play on one side of the board a
half-move deeper than its play on the other side.
